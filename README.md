Stickr is a full-stack ecommerce project developed at Fullstack Academy which utilizes the NERDS stack (Node.js, Express, React, Databases using SQL).

Check out [Stickr](https://stickr-shop.herokuapp.com/)!

## Setup

To use the `stickr` project locally, you'll need to make use of npm (Node Package Manager).
If you don't have NPM installed already, you can do so [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

## Run the code in local development environment

* `npm install`
* `create db stickr`
* `npm run seed` (in order to generate your database)
* `npm start` or if you want to run the server and/or webpack separately, you can also \* `npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`

* browse to http://localhost:8080/

ALL OF THESE COMMANDS SHOULD MAKE STICKR APP RUNNING
